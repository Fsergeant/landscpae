=========

This repository contains a series of landscapes made in openscad to be printed with the Z-corp printer. These landscapes were meant to be abstract and symbolic like language. They are made to exploit the material properties of z-corp prints, specifically their fragility and ability to sustain overhangs without visible support material. Zcorp prints function as 3D images. These prints are more like paintings than sculptures.
